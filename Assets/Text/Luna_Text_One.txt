Ah, I like this song much better,
Don’t you remember this band? We were obsessed with them in what, seventh, eighth grade?
You used to talk about stealing a truck and driving off down the I-90 with this kind of music playing.
No parents, no homophobic teachers, no cul-de-sacs...
Would've been the life.
Though this highway doesn't seem like it's as nice as what we envisioned.
Three cheers for romanticization.
We were so different back then, weren't we.
I mean, I guess everyone changes after they leave high school, but still. You get what I mean.
I wanted to be a marine biologist, and you wanted to be...
What was it, a painter? I think it was a painter.
...Oh wait, that's right. You're in art school now, aren't you.
I'm glad you're getting to study what you want.
Even though I can't.
…
I didn't say that to make you feel bad. I'm sorry.
Uhm, what kind of paintings do you make? You used to like abstraction, right?
Still into that?
Cool, cool.
Maybe you could show me some of your work sometime.
…
Mind changing the song again? Maybe something a bit quieter.
