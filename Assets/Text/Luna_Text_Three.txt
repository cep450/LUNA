So. How have you been?
…Sorry. I know that’s a loaded question.
It’s been a rough couple of years for both of us, hasn’t it.
Has the HRT been working out for you?
Oh good, good. I’m glad to hear it.
And I’m glad you were able to come into who you are.
You seem much happier than you were in high school.
…Look. I’m really sorry about how everything went down senior year.
I just… It looked like you had everything I always wanted.
I was jealous. And really fucking angry.
At the town, at our families, at life, at you…
And I’m sorry I took it all out on you.
I’m genuinely happy you’re doing better now, Spencer.
…
Switch up the music again, would you?
Maybe something slow again? Something relaxing. Lofi. Intrumental.
