Hell yeah. Chill vibes, dude.
…
Damn. Didn’t know there was a forest around here.
Actually. Uhm. Where is here, anyways?
Don’t know, huh. Well, I guess it doesn’t really matter.
Honestly, being surrounded by nothing and not knowing where you are…
It’s kind of peaceful, isn’t it?
I know you find it unsettling. Or at least, you used to.
I used to think that was ironic, since you liked being alone so much.
But not a week went by when you didn’t drag into the city.
Granted, the city was definitely worth the drive.
Especially since we only had that one main street in the entire damned town.
But still, this is just… so much calmer.
Nothing around for miles.
Just us, some tunes, the mountains, the moon…
Wouldn’t ask for anything more.
Though, I might ask for another song change.
Something more upbeat this time. Some electronic, maybe?
